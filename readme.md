# React UMD

POC to render React components in UMD format.

## What is UMD ?

>UMD (Universal Module Definition) these are modules which are capable of working everywhere, be it in the client, on the server or elsewhere. The UMD pattern typically attempts to offer compatibility with the most popular script loaders. In many cases it uses AMD as a base, with special-casing added to handle CommonJS compatibility.
